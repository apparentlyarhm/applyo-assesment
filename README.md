# GET SHIT DONE!

a small TODO app built with Next, MongoDB, deployed on vercel [here](https://gsd.arhm.dev/) (putting my domain to good use)

## running local

- dont bother- too much work (refer `.env.example` to understand why)

## Notes

- instead on CRUD on a JSON based storage or in-memory, I opted on "CRUD" on `localStorage`
- can login via github to sync. (no need to implement full auth myself for small app like this. plus its easy to extend to other providers)
- snapshots are sent to MongoDB


## Future Plans

- might actually make it into a full app- with proper sync and "offline-first" use. maybe a whole JIRA board types
